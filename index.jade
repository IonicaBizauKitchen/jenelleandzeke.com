  Join Zeke, Jenelle, and Cosmos this summer for a celebration of love and togetherness with our closest friends and relatives.
  The ceremony and reception will be held at the [Montclair Women's Cultural Arts Club](http://goo.gl/raRba3) in the hills of Oakland, California.
  This quiet and charming venue is just 30 minutes from San Francisco by automobile, and about an hour from Napa or Sonoma.

  The basic schedule is this: On **Saturday**, the ceremony and reception will be held at 
  the [Montclair Women's Cultural Arts Club](http://goo.gl/raRba3) in Oakland. On **Sunday**, we'll host a picnic in San Francisco's [Golden Gate Park](http://www.golden-gate-park.com/).

h2#travel Travel
  
:markdown
  If you're flying, you'll probably want land at **OAK** or **SFO**. To search for cheap flights, try [google.com/flights](https://www.google.com/flights/#search;f=ABQ;t=SFO,OAK;d=2015-06-26;r=2015-06-29), which has fares for most popular airlines. Give [southwest.com](https://www.southwest.com/) a try too, as their flights are not listed by any other service.

  If you're coming by train, take the [California Zephyr](http://www.amtrak.com/california-zephyr-train) or the [Coast Starlight](http://www.amtrak.com/coast-starlight-train) to Emeryville or Jack London Square in Oakland.
  
  If you're driving, you're driving.
